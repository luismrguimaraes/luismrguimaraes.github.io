First of all, happy 2024!!

I recently took a course on sound synthesis and ended up creating a polyphonic synthesizer that seems to be very powerful for creating chaotic sounds. A showcase as well as the source code are available [here](https://github.com/luismrguimaraes/Digital-Polyphonic-Synth).

Besides, I started releasing music under the name [Luís Guimarães](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2YebG2VtqUxGiMf6MgV70N?si=ovsla1DkSY2c-xBzLmUDog) using DistroKid, and have already released:
- An [orchestral piece](https://open.spotify.com/track/06N3nQejsr52WLTf79HU82?si=a4faf286f51449f6) which I made some time ago for a one-minute challenge based on the word "abyss";
- The [soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/58YJ4kb71rwQrRg67x0aSw?si=msbNiCHTSguf2_Ht9GKo7g) of the game [FEUPocalypse](..//Game_Development);
- And a recent track with jazz fusion elements called [Stabilizing Chaos](https://open.spotify.com/track/6jHbvpd0IX8mkSjYmpCGmH?si=b9ceb7d85b274501). 

This year, I intend to release even more music and continue next year if it goes well. Wish me luck! XD

Have a great 2024!!
