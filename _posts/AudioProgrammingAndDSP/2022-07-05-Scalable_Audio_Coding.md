I wrote an paper for my degree that I'd like to post here. It is about Scalable Audio Coding which is a subset of Audio Coding. Scalable audio formats allow truncation to happen in order to reduce precision. This reduction is expected to result in worse quality but a smaller file size.

Audio coding (or audio compression) is also briefly explained in the paper and it should be somewhat informative for people who have not heard about this topic before (like I hadn't, before I started researching about it).
