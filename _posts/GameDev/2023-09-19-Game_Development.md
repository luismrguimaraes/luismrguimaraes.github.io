Hi again, long time no see. While I was away, I managed to take part in the development of two video-games, in both of which I also did the sound design. 

- The first game is [FEUPocalypse](https://hail-seitan.itch.io/feupocalypse) in which you try to survive (not unlike [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)), with a particular feature: a store where you buy weapons.

- The second game is [Lost Depths](https://pspereira.itch.io/lost-depths). This one tells a story of a now uninhabitable planet. It includes puzzle-solving as well as pseudo-exploration.

If you do try any of the games, do let me know about your experience.
