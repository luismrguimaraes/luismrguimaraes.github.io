## Hi,

I'm making this post as means of celebrating the fact that the website *seems* to be working. Now I can start posting about stuff I learn and do, and maybe that will inspire someone else.

As you can see at the bottom right of the website, it is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) theme so it's not like I did the difficult part, that's on [these](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/graphs/contributors) and [these](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/graphs/contributors) individuals. But it still took some learning to get it working and that's why I'm celebrating.

Since I don't drink alcohol and I'm not thirsty right now, instead of drinking, I propose we appreciate this simplistic yet wonderful [picture](/assets/img/oceanPic.jpg):
