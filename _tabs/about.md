I've just finished my Computer Science degree and would love to work some day in audio programming/audio signal processing which I've been learning about in my free time. I find that using code and math to shape sound is very satisfying.

Even though my capabilities are still fairly limited, I'm motivated to become the best audio developer I can be.
