It is about Scalable Audio Coding which is a subset of Audio Coding. Scalable audio formats allow truncation to happen in order to reduce precision. This reduction is expected to result in worse quality but a smaller file size. Audio coding (or audio compression) is also briefly explained in the article and it should be somewhat info... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Sinc Interpolation</title><link href="https://luismrguimaraes.github.io/posts/Sinc_interpolation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sinc Interpolation" /><published>2022-06-11T16:35:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-06-27T09:32:59+01:00</updated> <id>https://luismrguimaraes.github.io/posts/Sinc_interpolation/</id> <content src="https://luismrguimaraes.github.io/posts/Sinc_interpolation/" /> <author> <name>Luís Miguel Rodrigues Guimarães</name> </author> <category term="Audio Programming and DSP" /> <summary> At some point, I think it’s safe to say that every individual studying digital signal processing wondered how a digital signal (which is discrete/sample-based) was able to accurately represent a sound wave which is continuous. It turns out that, apart from the quantization errors introduced during the sampling process, we can accurately reconstruct our continuous analog signal using sinc inte... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Fresh Website</title><link href="https://luismrguimaraes.github.io/posts/FreshWebsite/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fresh Website" /><published>2022-06-10T15:35:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-06-10T15:35:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://luismrguimaraes.github.io/posts/FreshWebsite/</id> <content src="https://luismrguimaraes.github.io/posts/FreshWebsite/" /> <author> <name>Luís Miguel Rodrigues Guimarães</name> </author> <summary> Hi, I’m making this post as means of celebrating the fact that the website seems to be working. Now I can start posting about stuff I learn and do, and maybe that will inspire someone else. As you can see at the bottom right of the website, it is powered by Jekyll and uses the Chirpy theme so it’s not like I did the difficult part, that’s on these and these individuals. But it still took some... </summary> </entry> </feed>
