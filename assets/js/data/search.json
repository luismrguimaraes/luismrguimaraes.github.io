It is about Scalable Audio Coding which is a subset of Audio Coding. Scalable audio formats allow truncation to happen in order to reduce precision. This reduction is expected to result in worse quality but a smaller file size.Audio coding (or audio compression) is also briefly explained in the article and it should be somewhat informative for people who have not heard about this topic before (like I hadn’t, before I started researching about it).Download" }, { "title": "Sinc Interpolation", "url": "/posts/Sinc_interpolation/", "categories": "Audio Programming and DSP", "tags": "dsp, graphs", "date": "2022-06-11 16:35:00 +0100", "snippet": "At some point, I think it’s safe to say that every individual studying digital signal processing wondered how a digital signal (which is discrete/sample-based) was able to accurately represent a sound wave which is continuous.It turns out that, apart from the quantization errors introduced during the sampling process, we can accurately reconstruct our continuous analog signal using sinc interpolation. Here is the sinc function:\\[\\begin{align} \\DeclareMathOperator{\\sinc}{sinc} \\sinc(x) &amp;= \\dfrac{\\sin(\\pi x)}{\\pi x}\\end{align}\\]I made a graph1 that shows the original signal (dark grey), the interpolated signal (blue), as well as the sinc functions centered and scaled at every sample (random colours). If we interpolate using continuous sinc functions centered and scaled at every sample of our digital signal and then sum everything (this is also known as convolution), we get an accurate reconstruction of our continuous signal. This property is useful if we want to upsample (like we did in the example) and also when converting to the analog domain, which works with continuous signals. In this example, the interpolated signal is still a digital signal since we are still working in the digital domain. &#8617; " }, { "title": "Fresh Website", "url": "/posts/FreshWebsite/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-06-10 15:35:00 +0100", "snippet": "Hi,I’m making this post as means of celebrating the fact that the website seems to be working. Now I can start posting about stuff I learn and do, and maybe that will inspire someone else.As you can see at the bottom right of the website, it is powered by Jekyll and uses the Chirpy theme so it’s not like I did the difficult part, that’s on these and these individuals. But it still took some learning to get it working and that’s why I’m celebrating.Since I don’t drink alcohol and I’m not thirsty right now, instead of drinking, I propose we appreciate this simplistic yet wonderful picture." } ]
